E-Learning Hub Readme
Hey folks!

Welcome to our E-Learning Hub project, the brainchild of our awesome hackathon team. We're super excited to share what we've been cooking up with you.

What's This Project All About?
In a nutshell, we've created an E-Learning platform where teachers can dish out their knowledge in the form of courses, and students can gobble up that knowledge. Simple, right?

Features You'll Love
Teachers Rule: Teachers, this one's for you! You can easily post your courses for hungry minds to devour. Share your wisdom with the world!

Student Mode: Students, buckle up! Dive into a sea of courses and soak up knowledge like a sponge. Learn at your own pace.

Unlock the Secrets: Guess what? We've got a little surprise. If teachers are feeling generous, they can un-encrypt their courses, and even non-students and non-teachers can sneak a peek!

How to Dive In
Sign Up: If you want to be a part of this learning fiesta, sign up! Choose whether you're a student or a teacher. Or just a curious wanderer – that's cool too.

Explore Courses: Students, go wild! Check out the smorgasbord of courses laid out for you. Find something that tickles your brain.

Teachers, Share Away: Teachers, click that magical button to share your knowledge. Don't forget, you can choose to keep it exclusive or open to everyone.

Decrypt & Discover: Teachers feeling a bit rebellious? Un-encrypt those courses and let the world in on the secrets!

Tech Magic Behind the Scenes
We won't bore you with too many details, but let's just say we used some serious tech mojo to make this happen – a bit of coding here, a dash of design there. It's like a secret recipe, but for E-Learning.

We want to make this platform as awesome as possible, and we need your help! Found a bug? Got a suggestion? Want to shower us with compliments? Head over to our feedback section and let your thoughts flow.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy learning!

Cheers,
